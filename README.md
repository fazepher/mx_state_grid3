Grid of Mexican states for use within geofacet R package

As an example, we can make a visualization of the 2018 Federal Election to the Senate. In each of the 32 Mexican states (formally, CDMX is not a state, but let's skeep that), parties present an ordered two candidates ticket. The first place ticket gets to send both its candidates to the Senate, this is known in Mexico as "Mayoría Relativa" (MR1/MR2 in the plot). The second place ticket only gets its first candidate elected as a "Primera Minoría" Senator (PM on the plot). Parties can form a coalition to present a ticket, but individual candidates must be asigned to a specific party, therefore we can see how Senators from each party were elected and with what share of votes.

Just for completeness, I will say that Mexico's Senate election is a mixed system with these 96 (64 MR + 32 PM) directly elected Senators and 32 Senators elected proportionally according to the national share of votes each party had.
